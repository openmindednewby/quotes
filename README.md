## Getting Started

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Launch a local web server (for example with `serve` or `http-server`) and open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Modify `quotes-data.js` to expand the catalog or update metadata.

## Deployment
- The site is optimized for static hosting and can be deployed to any CDN or object storage provider.
- Update [`sitemap.xml`](sitemap.xml) and [`robots.txt`](robots.txt) when publishing to ensure search engines can discover the latest content.
